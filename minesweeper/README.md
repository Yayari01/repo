Implemented an AI agent that solves Minesweeper boards using logical inference and probabilistic search (knowledge base + sentence logic).

- Solves boards of varying difficulty with high success rate. - Demonstrates constraint satisfaction, inference rules, and decision-making under uncertainty.

**Business Application** Optimization and conditional logic skills directly apply to client automations, such as: - Complex workflow routing in Zapier/Make.com - Decision trees for lead qualification - Rule-based processing in data pipelines

Run with `python minesweeper.py` (or main script name). Requirements: listed in `requirements.txt`.
