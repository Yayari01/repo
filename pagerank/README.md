PageRank - Graph Ranking Algorithm (CS50AI Project)

Implemented Google's PageRank algorithm to rank nodes in a graph based on link structure and importance.

- Processes graph data to compute convergence-based rankings. - Demonstrates iterative algorithms, matrix operations, and damping factors.

**Business Application** Graph-based ranking and prioritization skills directly apply to client automations, such as: - Lead scoring and recommendation systems - Data prioritization in workflows - Network analysis for marketing or CRM integrations

Run with `python pagerank.py` (or main script name). Requirements: listed in `requirements.txt`.
