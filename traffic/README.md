Trained a machine learning model using TensorFlow to classify German traffic signs from the GTSRB dataset.

- Achieves high accuracy on real-world images. - Demonstrates image preprocessing, convolutional neural networks, and model evaluation.

**Business Application** Image classification and object detection skills directly apply to client AI integrations, such as: - Automated document/photo processing - Lead scoring from visual data - Custom AI tools for content moderation or inventory

Run with `python traffic.py` (or main script name). Requirements: listed in `requirements.txt`.
